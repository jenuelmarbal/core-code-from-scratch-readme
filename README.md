6. Blend both of the mixes.
7. knead the dough.
8. Shape the dough in a circular shape.
9. Cut the onions, tomates and garlic.
10. Add to a pan olive oil and the previous ingredients and the vinager.
11. Cook till boil.
12. Add the sauce and the soy meat on top of the dough.
13. Bake for 20 min. in a preheated oven at 220¬∞
14. Cut and serve the pizza.
15. Enjoy :) 

## Hot N Cold ü§í üßä üî•
1. Read the temperature
2. If the temperature is in Celsius, convert it to Fahrenheit with the following formula 
- Multiply by 1.8
- Add to the previous result 32.
- The result will be the temperature in Fahrenheit.
3. If the temperature is in Fanhrenheit, convert it to Celsius with the following formula 
- Subtract 32 from the temperature in Fahrenheit
- Multiply by .5556 the previous result.
- The result will be the temperature in Celsius.
4. End

## Some geometry üìê
1. Ask with volume is the needed (cube, pyramid or sphere)
2. If the answer is cube then: <br>
2.1 ask the length of one side (all three sides are equal in measure) <br>
2.2 Represent this value as "a" <br>
2.3 Replace "a" with the value from the cube in the following operation a √ó a √ó a <br>
2.4 Make the operation <br>
2.5 the result is the value of the volume  <br>
3. If the answer is pyramid then: <br>
3.1 Ask for the lenght from the base, the width and the height <br>
3.2 Replace in the following formula Volume of a Pyramid = 1/3 √ó Base length √ó Base width √ó height <br>
3.3 Make the operation <br>
3.4 The result is the value of the volume <br>
4. If the answer is sphere then: <br>
4.1 Ask for the radius of the sphere <br>
4.2 Replace the value in the following formula 4/3 œÄr¬≥ <br>
4.3 Make the operation <br>
4.4 The result is the value of the volume <br>
5. End

## Numbers üìà

## How old are you üë¥
1. Ask the subject for their date of birth 
2. Assign the result date_of_birth
3. Assing the date of today as today_date
4. subtract today_date - date_of_birth
5. print the result
6. end

## Find the treasure üëë

We are in a room with three chests. We know that at least one has a treasure in it. Each chest has a message, but all the messages are lies.

If all of them are lying then: <br>
Left chest: The middle chest has a treasure = Since it is a lie the treasure is not in the middle chest <br>
Middle chest: All these chests have treasures in them = Because it is a lie no all of them would have treasures however some of them might have them <br>
Right chest: Only one of these chests has treasures. = Since it is a lie, it is impossible just for one to have treasures <br>

According to the previous analysis there are two possibilities, the first none of them have trasures and the second the left and right chest have treasures, nevertheless the instruccions says that at leat one has treasure therefore the left and right chest is the correct answer. 

## Logic problem
The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday". <br>
Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday". <br>
Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday". <br>
Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday". <br>
Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday". <br>

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?

If Alice is telling the truth tha means nobody study however since those who are telling the truth studied that means that Alice did study therefore is contradictory and impossible. 

The only student which could be possible being telling the truth is Bob because is the only one who does not contradict itself therefore he studied and if other student would be telling the truth that would be impossible since there are different sentences like nobody, 2, 3 and 4 people and all of them contradict each other except Bob.
