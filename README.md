## Hot N Cold 🤒 🧊 🔥
1. Read the temperature
2. If the temperature is in Celsius, convert it to Fahrenheit with the following formula 
- Multiply by 1.8
- Add to the previous result 32.
- The result will be the temperature in Fahrenheit.
3. If the temperature is in Fanhrenheit, convert it to Celsius with the following formula 
- Subtract 32 from the temperature in Fahrenheit
- Multiply by .5556 the previous result.
- The result will be the temperature in Celsius.

## Some geometry 📐
1. Ask with volume is the needed (cube, pyramid or sphere)
2. If the answer is cube then: <br>
2.1 ask the length of one side (all three sides are equal in measure) <br>
2.2 Represent this value as "a" <br>
2.3 Replace "a" with the value from the cube in the following operation a × a × a <br>
2.4 Make the operation <br>
2.5 the result is the value of the volume  <br>
3. If the answer is pyramid then: <br>
3.1 Ask for the lenght from the base, the width and the height <br>
3.2 Replace in the following formula Volume of a Pyramid = 1/3 × Base length × Base width × height <br>
3.3 Make the operation <br>
3.4 The result is the value of the volume <br>
4. If the answer is sphere then: <br>
4.1 Ask for the radius of the sphere <br>
4.2 Replace the value in the following formula 4/3 πr³ <br>
4.3 Make the operation <br>
4.4 The result is the value of the volume <br>
5. End
