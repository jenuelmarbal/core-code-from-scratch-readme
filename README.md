## Hot N Cold 🤒 🧊 🔥
1. Read the temperature
2. If the temperature is in Celsius, convert it to Fahrenheit with the following formula 
- Multiply by 1.8
- Add to the previous result 32.
- The result will be the temperature in Fahrenheit.
3. If the temperature is in Fanhrenheit, convert it to Celsius with the following formula 
- Subtract 32 from the temperature in Fahrenheit
- Multiply by .5556 the previous result.
- The result will be the temperature in Celsius.

## Some geometry 📐
1. Ask with volume is the needed (cube, pyramid or sphere)
2. If the answer is cube then: <br>
2.1 ask the length of one side (all three sides are equal in measure) <br>
2.2 Represent this value as "a" <br>
2.3 Replace "a" with the value from the cube in the following operation a × a × a <br>
2.4 Make the operation <br>
2.5 the result is the value of the volume  <br>
3. If the answer is pyramid then: <br>
3.1 Ask for the lenght from the base, the width and the height <br>
3.2 Replace in the following formula Volume of a Pyramid = 1/3 × Base length × Base width × height <br>
3.3 Make the operation <br>
3.4 The result is the value of the volume <br>
4. If the answer is sphere then: <br>
4.1 Ask for the radius of the sphere <br>
4.2 Replace the value in the following formula 4/3 πr³ <br>
4.3 Make the operation <br>
4.4 The result is the value of the volume <br>
5. End

## Find the treasure 👑

We are in a room with three chests. We know that at least one has a treasure in it. Each chest has a message, but all the messages are lies.

If all of them are lying then:
Left chest: The middle chest has a treasure = Since it is a lie the treasure is not in the middle chest <br>
Middle chest: All these chests have treasures in them = Because it is a lie no all of them would have treasures however some of them might have them <br>
Right chest: Only one of these chests has treasures. = Since it is a lie, it is impossible just for one to have treasures <br>

According to the previous analysis there are two possibilities, the first none of them have trasures and the second the left and right chest have treasures, nevertheless the instruccions says that at leat one has treasure therefore the left and right chest is the correct answer.
